=head1 NAME

rvm.pl

=head1 WARNING!

This is an unstable development release not ready for production!

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.004003

=head1 SYNOPSIS

rvm.pl will provide a subset of the bash rvm.

=head1 INSTALL RUBY

It is recommended to use Ruby::VersionManager with local::lib to avoid interference with possibly installed system ruby.
Ruby::VersionManager comes with a script rvm.pl with following options.

=head2 version

Show the version of Ruby::VersionManager.

	rvm.pl version

=head2 list

List available ruby versions.

	rvm.pl list

=head2 updatedb

Update database of available ruby versions.

	rvm.pl updatedb

=head2 install

Install a ruby version. If no version is given the latest stable release will be installed.
The program tries to guess the correct version from the provided string. It should at least match the major release.
If you need to install a preview or rc version you will have to provide the full exact version.

Latest ruby

	rvm.pl install

Latest ruby-1.8

	rvm.pl install 1.8

Install preview

	rvm.pl install ruby-1.9.3-preview1

To use the Ruby::VersionManager source ruby_vmanager.rc.

	source ~/.ruby_vmanager/var/ruby_vmanager.rc

After installation a subshell will be launched with the new settings.

=head2 uninstall

Remove a ruby version and the source dir including the downloaded archive.
You have to provide the full exact version of the ruby you want to remove as shown with list.

	rvm.pl uninstall ruby-1.9.3-preview1

If you uninstall your currently active ruby version you have to install/activate another version manually.

=head2 gem

Pass arguments to the gem command.

	rvm.pl gem install unicorn # installs unicorn

Additionally you can use reinstall to reinstall your complete gemset. With a file containing the output of 'gem list' you can reproduce gemsets.

	rvm.pl gem reinstall gem_list.txt # installs all gems in the list exactly as given

	rvm.pl gem reinstall # reinstalls all installed gems

=head2 gemset

Switch to another set of gems and launch a subshell with the new settings.

	rvm.pl gemset my_set

=head2 gemsets

List gemsets of the currently used rubyversion.

	rvm.pl gemsets

The current set is marked with an asterisk.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

Currently Ruby::VersionManager is only running on Linux.
